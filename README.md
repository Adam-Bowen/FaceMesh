# FaceMesh

This project implements a real-time face mesh detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. It captures video from your webcam, detects facial landmarks, and displays them on a black background.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

- Real-time face mesh detection
- Mirror effect for natural interaction
- FPS (Frames Per Second) calculation
- Lower resolution setting for improved performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

## Usage
